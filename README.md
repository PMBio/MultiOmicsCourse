# MultiOmicsCourse

## Description:
This course provides insights into the foundations and principles of multi-omics data analysis and modeling,. The course is aimed specifically for students with experience in Python programming, eager to apply and broaden their skills in single-cell genomics and multi-omics  setting. This is a four day course, consisting of lectures in the morning and practicals in the afternoon.

- [Day 1](day1/):  will provide foundations in multi omics technologies and analysis
- [Day 2](day2/):  will focus on basics of machine and supervised analysis of single-cell data,
- [Day 3](day3/):  will focus on unsupervised exploration of multi-omics bulk and single-cell assay
- [Day 4](day4/):  will introduce spatial multi-omics analytics and integration.
